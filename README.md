# API Documentation
By default, the application deploys in Port 8080. The API documentation is maintained with Swagger.
- **Swagger URL:** http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/
- **Postman Collection:** All the API's are maintained as a Postman Collection. Please find the collection file in `0.7-Postman-Collection` directory inside `documentation` folder.
  - **Postman API usage details:** After successfully importing the Postman collection `SWE-Annapurna` by using the provided`.json` file. 
    - First use `POST Login` API
      - There are three valid users with different `Roles` with following user credentials 
        ```
        username: derartu, password: derartu
        username: shelly, password: shelly
        username: bijay, password: bijay```
    - Then you can use any APIs using the provided `access_token`

# SQL Scripts
I used the SQL scripts inside `0.8-Default-SQL-Scripts` to test my APIs but they are not mandatory to execute.
It basically helps you enter the Daily Meal Rating received between `2022-07-13` and `2022-07-14`. _Note: Execute them in the file order._
